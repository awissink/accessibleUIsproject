    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica">Why is Digital Accessibility Important for Engineers?</h2>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica">One of the largest accessibility problems in the technology industry is the fact that developers do not write code from an accessible standpoint initially. Rather, they focus on pushing out a product and driving up profits for their company, leaving accessibility issues on the backburner. This leads to technology companies having to “play catch-up” with accessibility issues down the line.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica">So, why are developers not designing accessibly in the first place? The 2020 paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3334480.3383103">Why Software Is Not Accessible: Technology Professionals’ Perspectives and Challenges</a> gives us some insights into the phenomenon of inaccessible technology and its root causes. The study found that “due to little to no formal education in accessibility,” developers are “inadequately prepared to make use of scarce resources within tight deadlines to include accessibility on the job.” Only 35% of survey respondents reported that they sufficiently learned about accessibility in schooling. The study also found that companies were primarily focused on financial goals, resulting in “accessibility considered as an extra time and resource cost.” Survey respondents also indicated their concerns with the lack of resources surrounding accessible development, one of them expressing that “it's important to boil down the accessibility guidelines/laws into something more digestible if you're a developer with many other responsibilities.” The study concludes by asserting that it is difficult to retroactively address accessibility issues in the middle of the development cycle, especially for large-scale projects, and that it is crucial to develop “concrete tools and clearly written resources to support tight development cycles and non-web accessibility needs.” </p>
    
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica">Additionally, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/accessibility-awareness-is-on-the-rise-but-is-it-turning-into-action/">2021 TechCrunch article</a> outlines how accessibility awareness is rising in the technology industry; however, not much action is actually being taken by big technology companies. According to the 2021 State of Accessibility Report, many companies are mastering alternative texts and headings, but they’re struggling with color contrast and ARIA. In order to truly progress in digital accessibility, companies must make it part of their culture. Building an accessibility-first culture starts by giving developers the right range and depth of resources to learn about accessibility beyond the bare basics. </p>
    
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica">Thus, there is a clear issue in the technology industry: a lack of centralized and specific resources pertaining to accessible user interface design. Our website aims to provide these resources, specifically tailored to every developer’s needs, in an effort to promote accessible user interface design across the industry.
